# Flight-Data-Analysis-using-Python-and-R
The flights dataset from the Harvard Dataverse, covering the years 2006 and 2007, was utilized for this project. The data underwent cleaning before performing a comprehensive analysis using the available variables.

Visualizations were created in both R and Python to address the following research questions.,

1.When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?

2.Do older planes suffer more delays?

3.How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?

4.Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?

5.Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.

Conducted a thorough analysis of commercial flights, passenger travel habits, and cascading delays between airports using both Python and R. Feature selection was performed, and a logistic regression model was developed to predict future flight delays in real-world scenarios. A comprehensive report was compiled, incorporating data visualizations from both Python and R, which demonstrated that consistent conclusions were reached with both tools.
